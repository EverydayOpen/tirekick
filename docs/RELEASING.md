# Releasing Tirekick

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag (digits only; `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tags go to [beta.yml](../.github/workflows/beta.yml) instead) runs
[.github/workflows/release.yml](../.github/workflows/release.yml) in three jobs:

1. **build** first runs a preflight that fails before any build time: the tag's version must have a `CHANGELOG.md`
   section; `site/site.json`'s `baseURL` and `Links.website` in `App/Links.swift` must be real and agree
   (`bash tools/doctor.sh --ci`); `releasesRepo` must be this repository and `dmgName` must be `Tirekick.dmg`; and
   `notarytool` must accept the App Store Connect key. The job then archives a universal (arm64 + x86_64) Developer ID
   build with the hardened runtime, checks that both architectures and the camera and microphone entitlements are in
   the signed app, and launches it on the arm64 runner (it must stay up for 10 seconds). Only then does it notarize
   and staple the app, and build, sign, notarize and staple the DMG.
2. **smoke-intel** launches the same signed app on GitHub's Intel runner (`macos-15-intel`).
3. **publish** runs only when both launch tests passed. It creates the GitHub Release in this repo with the changelog
   section as its notes, and uploads the DMG twice: `Tirekick-X.Y.Z.dmg`, and `Tirekick.dmg`, which the site's
   `/download/` follows through `releases/latest/download/Tirekick.dmg`.

There is no Sparkle and no appcast: the app never goes online, so the website's download link is the update path.
Everything around the release (GitHub Pages, legal review, the name check) is in [GO_LIVE.md](GO_LIVE.md).

Everything below works from Windows (Git Bash has `openssl` and `base64`). You only need a Mac to check the result.

## One-time setup

Do all of this **outside the repo folder**. `.gitignore` blocks `*.p12`, `*.p8`, `*.key` and `*.pem`, but key
material should never be in the working tree at all. Keep an offline backup of `devid.key`, `devid.p12` and the
`.p8` file (a password manager works).

### 1. Apple Developer Program

- Enroll as an **Individual** ($99/year). In India, enrollment only works through the **Apple Developer app** on an
  iPhone or iPad. Approval isn't instant, so start now: Tirekick never launches publicly unsigned.
- Write down your **Team ID** (developer.apple.com › Account › Membership details). It becomes the
  `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` secret.

### 2. Developer ID Application certificate (no Mac needed)

```sh
openssl genrsa -out devid.key 2048
# MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1: Git Bash rewrites arguments starting with '/' into Windows paths, which breaks -subj
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 openssl req -new -key devid.key -out devid.csr -subj "/emailAddress=you@example.com/CN=Your Name/C=IN"
```

Go to developer.apple.com › Certificates, IDs & Profiles › Certificates › **+** › **Developer ID Application**
(G2 Sub-CA), upload `devid.csr` and download `developerID_application.cer`. Then:

```sh
openssl x509 -inform DER -in developerID_application.cer -out devid.pem
# Legacy PKCS#12 algorithms so `security import` on the runner accepts the file
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey devid.key -in devid.pem -out devid.p12 \
  -keypbe PBE-SHA1-3DES -certpbe PBE-SHA1-3DES -macalg sha1 -passout pass:CHOOSE_A_PASSWORD
base64 -w0 devid.p12 > devid.p12.b64
```

Only the Account Holder can create Developer ID certificates, and each account can have at most 5. The same
certificate signs Whydunit and Tirekick.

### 3. App Store Connect API key (for notarytool)

Go to App Store Connect › Users and Access › Integrations › **Team Keys**, generate a key with the Developer role,
and download `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8`. You can download it only once. Write down the **Key ID** and the **Issuer ID**
shown above the table, then run:

```sh
base64 -w0 AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 > authkey.p8.b64
```

Use a Team key: `--issuer` is required for Team keys and is rejected for Individual keys.

### 4. GitHub environment and secrets

Environment secrets, the `v*` rule and required reviewers need a public repo, or GitHub Pro for a private one
([GO_LIVE.md](GO_LIVE.md) step 2).

In the repo, go to Settings › Environments › **New environment** `release`, then:

- Under Deployment branches and tags, choose *Selected* and add the tag rule `v*`.
- Optionally, add yourself as a required reviewer so every signing run waits for your approval.

Add these as **environment secrets** of `release`. With the GitHub CLI you can pipe files, for example
`gh secret set DEVELOPER_ID_P12_BASE64 --env release < devid.p12.b64`.

| Secret | Value |
|---|---|
| `DEVELOPER_ID_P12_BASE64` | contents of `devid.p12.b64` |
| `DEVELOPER_ID_P12_PASSWORD` | the `.p12` password from step 2 |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | any random string |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` | your 10-character Team ID |
| `ASC_KEY_P8_BASE64` | contents of `authkey.p8.b64` |
| `ASC_KEY_ID` | Key ID from step 3 |
| `ASC_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer ID from step 3 |

The release and the website both publish with the workflow's own `github.token`, so there is no personal access
token to create or renew. `ExportOptions.plist` keeps `REPLACE_WITH_TEAM_ID`; the workflow fills in the real Team ID
from the secret.

## Tester betas

Tag `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` and push the tag. [beta.yml](../.github/workflows/beta.yml) builds an ad-hoc signed universal
app (hardened runtime off), launches it once, and publishes a GitHub pre-release with install steps for testers.
Pre-releases never become `releases/latest`, so the site's download link is unaffected. Betas are for invited
testers only: never announce an unsigned build publicly.

## Cutting a release

1. Make sure `main` is green in the **ci** workflow and `bash tools/doctor.sh` shows no `ERROR`.
2. Rename `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` to `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` (em dash, today's ISO date), check that the
   notes are written for users, and commit it, but don't push `main` yet. The section becomes the GitHub release
   notes and the site's changelog (`## Unreleased` is never published). Check it with
   `python tools/changelog.py notes X.Y.Z --format html`.
3. Tag that commit and push only the tag. The tag sets the version (`MARKETING_VERSION`), and the workflow run number
   sets the build number (`CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`). Don't edit the versions in `project.yml`.
   ```sh
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
4. Open Actions › **release**, approve the environment if you added a reviewer, and wait about 20 minutes. The
   **build** and **publish** jobs both use the `release` environment, so a reviewer approves twice: once to build
   and once to publish after both launch tests have passed. If a launch test fails, the job prints the newest crash
   report. If notarization fails, it prints Apple's notary log.
5. **Push `main` once publish has succeeded** (`git push origin main`). That push deploys the site with the new
   changelog entry; pushed earlier, the site would list a release that doesn't exist yet. Before 1.0 has a released
   section on `main`, `/download/` shows "Coming soon". If `main` moved meanwhile, `git pull --no-rebase` first: a
   rebase would leave the tagged commit off `main`.
6. **Verify on a Mac.** Download `Tirekick-1.0.0.dmg` from Releases, then:
   ```sh
   xcrun stapler validate Tirekick-1.0.0.dmg
   spctl -a -vvv -t open --context context:primary-signature Tirekick-1.0.0.dmg   # accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
   ```
   Open the DMG, drag the app to Applications and launch it. There should be no Gatekeeper warning. Then check:
   ```sh
   spctl -a -vvv /Applications/Tirekick.app
   codesign -dvv /Applications/Tirekick.app      # Authority=Developer ID Application, Timestamp=, flags=0x10000(runtime)
   lipo -archs /Applications/Tirekick.app/Contents/MacOS/Tirekick   # x86_64 arm64
   ```
   Run the checks, open the camera and microphone tests (macOS should ask for permission), and save a PNG and a PDF.
7. Check that `https://github.com/EverydayOpen/tirekick/releases/latest/download/Tirekick.dmg` downloads this version.

**Before the first public release,** tag a throwaway `v0.0.1` from a throwaway branch (with its own `CHANGELOG.md`
section, so the website never lists it), install it on a Mac, and check steps 6 and 7. This proves the certificate
and notarization work end to end. Delete the release afterwards
(`gh release delete v0.0.1 --cleanup-tag`).

If a release is broken, don't reuse its version. Delete it (`gh release delete vX.Y.Z --cleanup-tag`), fix the
problem and tag the next patch version.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `security import` fails with `-25264 MAC verification failed` | Re-export the `.p12` with the legacy flags in step 2. |
| codesign: "unable to build chain to self-signed root" | Import Apple's Developer ID G2 intermediate (`https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/DeveloperIDG2CA.cer`) into the CI keychain in the import step. |
| Notary log: "not signed with a valid Developer ID certificate" or "no secure timestamp" | Check that the identity is *Developer ID Application*, not Apple Development, and that `OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=--timestamp` is set. |
| notarytool returns 401 | A Team key needs `--issuer`. Check `ASC_ISSUER_ID` and that the key wasn't revoked. |
| Preflight: "CHANGELOG.md needs a '## X.Y.Z — …' section" | Add the section (em dash, ISO date, at least one line of notes), commit, delete the tag and push it again. |
| "is not universal" | Check that the archive ran with `ARCHS="arm64 x86_64"`. |
| "com.apple.security.device.camera is missing" | Check `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS: App/Tirekick.entitlements` in `project.yml`. Without it, hardened runtime blocks the camera and microphone tests. |
| Launch smoke test: "quit within 10 s of launch" | Read the crash report printed below the error. Crashes only on the Intel job usually mean an arm64-only binary, or an API newer than the runner's macOS used without `if #available`. |
